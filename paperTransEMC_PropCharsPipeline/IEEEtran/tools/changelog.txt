2015/08/26 V1.5 (V1.8b of IEEEtran.cls)

 1) Revised IEEEeqnarray column specifications to work with active " 
    (or other punctuation catcode changes) as with babel under the
    german or ngerman language modes. 
    Thanks to Stefan M. Moser for reporting this problem.

 2) Fixed bug with IEEEeqnarray equation number foreground color
    under the color environment of Beamer class.
    Thanks to Joschi Brauchle for reporting this problem.

 3) Added the \IEEEnoauxwrite command.
    Thanks to Sudarshan Mukherjee for suggesting this feature.


*******
2014/09/17 V1.4 (V1.8a of IEEEtran.cls) changes:

 1) Internal code improvements for command argument processing and
    support for future features.


*******
12/2012 V1.3 (V1.8 of IEEEtran.cls) changes:

 1) No longer redefines the standard LaTeX itemize, enumerate and 
    description (IED) lists by default. (e.g., the older package option
    "retainorgcmds" is now the default behavior.) A new package option,
    "redeflists", can be invoked to redefine the standard IED list
    environments to their IEEE versions. IEEEitemize, IEEEenumerate and
    IEEEdescription remain available in any case. The redeflists option
    may not be compatible with other packages that alter the standard
    IED list environments.

 2) Added new *-forms of \IEEEyesnumber*, \IEEEnonumber*, \IEEEyessubnumber*,
    and \IEEEnosubnumber* (the non-star form of the latter is also new) which
    persist across IEEEeqnarray lines until countermanded. To provide for
    continued subequations across instances of IEEEeqnarrays as well as for
    subequations that follow a main equation (e.g., 14, 14a, 14b ...)
    \IEEEyessubnumber no longer automatically increments the equation number
    on it's first invocation of a subequation group. Invoke both
    \IEEEyesnumber\IEEEyessubnumber together to start a new
    equation/subequation group.

 3) Hyperref links now work with IEEEeqnarray equations.
    Thanks to Stefan M. Moser for reporting this problem.

 4) Now provides the IEEEproof environment, as well as the
    \IEEEQEDhere, \IEEEQEDhereeqn and \IEEEQEDoff commands.
    Also, \IEEEproofindentspace allows users to change the
    IEEEproof indentation via \renewcommand.
    Thanks to Mark D. Butala, Hennadiy Leontyev and Stefan M. Moser
    for suggesting this. Special thanks to Stefan M. Moser for beta
    testing and additional suggestions which improved IEEEproof.

 5) Revised \IEEEeqnarraymulticol{} to allow inner alignments without
    requiring extra containing braces to prevent an incomplete \ifx error.
    Thanks to Stefan M. Moser and Auke van der Valk for reporting this
    problem.

 6) Added \IEEEauthorrefmark.

 7) Removed support for legacy IED list commands.
    IEEEtrantools no longer defines or references \labelindent so as to
    avoid namespace problems with list packages that define it.
    Thanks to Sven Köhler for reporting the problem with enumitem.sty.


*******
 1/2007 V1.2 (V1.7 of IEEEtran.cls) changes:

 1) Several commands and environments have depreciated in favor of
    replacements with IEEE prefixes to better avoid potential future name
    clashes with other packages. Legacy code retained to allow
    use of the obsolete forms, but with an warning message to the
    console during compilation:
    \IEEEPARstart
    For IED lists:
    \IEEEiedlabeljustifyc, \IEEEiedlabeljustifyl, \IEEEiedlabeljustifyr,
    \IEEEnocalcleftmargin, \IEEElabelindent, \IEEEsetlabelwidth,
    \IEEEusemathlabelsep
 
 2) These commands/lengths now require the IEEE prefix and do not have
    legacy support: \IEEEnormaljot.
    For IED lists: \ifIEEEnocalcleftmargin, \ifIEEEnolabelindentfactor,
    \IEEEiedlistdecl, \IEEElabelindentfactor

 3) \normalsizebaselineskip no longer provided.

 4) New \IEEEPARstart controls:
    \IEEEPARstartHEIGHTTEXT, \IEEEPARstartFONTSTYLE, \IEEEPARstartCAPSTYLE,
    \IEEEPARstartWORDFONTSTYLE, \IEEEPARstartWORDCAPSTYLE,
    \IEEEPARstartHOFFSET, \IEEEPARstartITLCORRECT
    and the (output) length \IEEEPARstartletwidth.

 5) Provide for an optional argument to \bstctlcite to provide a way to
    specify a different aux file.


*******
 11/2002 V1.1 (V1.6b of IEEEtran.cls) changes:
 
 1) In addition to the IEEE IED lists, the original LaTeX IED style list
    environments are now preserved as LaTeXitemize, LaTeXenumerate, and
    LaTeXdescription. Also, users can now redefine \makelabel within
    IEEE IED list controls. There may be some use for these in specialized
    applications. Thanks to Eli Barzilay for suggesting this feature.
