# OHLToolbox

Toolbox in MATLAB for modelling of overhead and underground transmission lines (per-unit-length parameters, propagation characteristics, frequency scan, transient simulations).

NOTICE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THE FINAL VERSIONS OF THE CODES MEANT FOR DISTRIBUTION ARE STILL BEING REVIEWED AND UPDATED. SO PLEASE BE PATIENT WHILE WE SET THE REPOSITORY.

We appreciate the interest in our research and we invite the interested users to use our codes as necessary. However, if you use the OHLToolbox as a part of academic research, we kindly ask you to refer to our work as per the references list on https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/130914-ohltoolbox.
